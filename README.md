🧠 Semantic Traits:
| Feature                           | Description                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hard Inlining**                 | Always inlines known paths for maximum CPU cache alignment.         |
| **Extendable Opcoding**           | Devs can inject new opcodes at runtime or compile-time.             |
| **Impeller Flow Control**         | Predictive branching + dynamic reroute + stateless fallback.        |
| **Channeled Recursion**           | Loopless recursive models for memory predictability.                |
| **Concentrated Parallelism**      | Microthreads and fibers at core-instruction scope.                  |
| **Dominant Error Captivating**    | All branches captured, classified, rerouted.                        |
| **Baked Contextual Optimization** | Optimization occurs during parsing and AST folding.                 |
| **Pathfinding Engine**            | Code navigates optimal execution paths (machine-learning optional). |
| **Hot Swapping**                  | Replace functions/modules in runtime without halt.                  |
| **Sequential Interop**            | Precise compatibility with C/C++ & Python (via CIL gateway).        |
| **Smooth Tagging**                | Capsule-aware metadata tagging for traceability & filtering.        |

📦 Capsule Architecture
Unit: .cmajcapsule

Execution: AOT+JIT hybrid

Capsule Properties:

Packetized: All data and execution are bundled

Non-Spilled: Registers/memory are locked in-flow

Schedule-Fused: Hierarchical tasks baked into streamable schedules

🔁 Loop/Recursion System
| Feature               | Description                                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Loop Unrolling**    | Auto by default; complete collapse of short loops into sequence |
| **Checkpointing**     | Rewind and re-execute capsule sections                          |
| **Folding**           | Constant and path folding during AST flattening                 |
| **Reversal & Replay** | Capsules can reverse and replay entire execution paths          |

🧩 Core Language Elements (Partial)
The language includes hundreds of tag-style or command-style keywords:

func, struct, class, object, param, bounds, break, checkpoint, module, namespace, capture,
say, return, throw, catch, rewind, replay, try, lateral, vertical, stack, heap, register,
pause, resume, proof, archive, expire, map, approximate, vector, assert, theorem, inject,
bit, byte, graphics, pixel, polarity, styling, evaluate, theory, expression, direction,
conditionals, base-12, superlatives, singular, plurality, time, measure, reverse, loop, raise,
shorthand, match, enum, share, ask, link, reference, deny, block, auto-suggestion, archive,
quantifiers, modifiers, definitions, memory, abstract, lex, inference, window, sliding scale

📘 Example Syntax:
func blend_color(vector r, vector g, vector b):
    let mix = (r + g + b) / 3
    return clamp(mix, 0, 255)
end

capsule main:
    pixel p = blend_color(vec3(80,120,200))
    show p
    if p > 100:
        say "Bright pixel!"
    else:
        say "Dim pixel."
    end
end
